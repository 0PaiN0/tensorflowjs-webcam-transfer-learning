# Tensorflowjs Webcam Transfer Learning
> This example shows you how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning.
> In this example, we'll use a pretrained MobileNet model and train another model using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 4 different classes from the webcam defined by the user.
